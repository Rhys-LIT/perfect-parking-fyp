- [x] You are required to use Roman Numerals for all of the pages before the Introduction

  - [x] Text for anything other than Body text should be left-aligned, including headings, table contents, and Reference lists.
- [x] Figures should always appear after the end of the paragraph in which they are first referenced, or as close as possible to that point to avoid having gaps between areas of text.
- [x] Do not interrupt a paragraph or a sentence to insert a figure or table.
- [x] Do not precede figures and tables with Chapter numbers (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, etc.). Figures should begin with Figure 1 and tables with Table 1.

- [ ]  The award appears underneath this (e.g., BSc. (Honours) in Computer Networks and Systems Management). The year of submission appears underneath this (e.g., 2019). You may place the LIT logo on the cover page if you wish, but you must use a high-quality version if you do.
- [ ]  The spine of the document must also include some information so that it can be identifiable on a library shelf. You need to include your name, the year, and the award, which can be abbreviated if it is too long to fit (e.g., BSc (Hons) SD).
