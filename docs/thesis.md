# Abstract

The aim of Perfect Parking is to create a parking system that will
replace outdated systems and to help stop the widespread problem that is
parking in our cities. The goal in this project is to improve the
effectiveness of finding parking spaces and to also relieve the stress
of the users looking for parking by implementing new and innovative
features. This will be done by building a client server APIs and website
that will show the user exactly where the parking is. The sever will be
supported by parking monitor clients powered by OpenCV to detect if a
parking spot has been filled or made empty.

# Introduction

Due to an increase in in the number of cars being used in limerick city
and other cities in Ireland, finding a solution to car parks has now
become vital. The old-fashioned way of parking was that everyone would
just leave their cars parked in the streets until they were needed
again, this however caused major traffic congestions in towns and
cities. Shop owners also got hugely impacted as there wouldn't be enough
room for staff to park no mind the customers looking to go into their
shops which was damaging for their business, it is undeniable that car
parks are a very important factor in society, by having parking spaces
it reduces illegal parking which would have increased congestions on the
road and increasing travel time.

Parking back in the 1980s -- 1990s wasn't such a big issue as there
wasn't very many cars on the road as people couldn't afford to have a
car unless they were wealthy, nowadays however it is very hard to find
available parking spaces in places such as cities, and of course
universities especially during rush hour. Since limerick City is a big
city for students to come and study in with there being over 16,000
students attending university of limerick and just under 2000 students
in TUS and Mary I, this brings so much more motor vehicles into limerick
city which is a city already struggling with car parking. (University of
Limerick, 2022)

The goal is to try and reduce this issue by building a new innovative
parking app and to try to help motorists stop stressing about this
parking crisis.

## The academic objectives

The academic objectives of this project are to study and gain experience
working with AI and object detection in images. The chosen problem used
for this study is to help to reduce the traffic congestion in cities
such as Limerick.

## The problem

Ineffective ways of finding an available parking space which is a waste
of time, very fuel consuming and causes traffic jams. hen road users are
looking to find an available parking space they end up wasting time and
using a lot of fuel from them driving around the car park or the block
multiple times hopping to find a space, on average people spend 17 hours
per year driving around looking for parking spaces (Quellmalz, 2021). By
developing Perfect Parking, it is hoped to make the parking process in
college campus and in the city seamless and stress free, by doing this
I'm hoping to eliminate the time and fuel waste road users encounter
while looking for parking.

Lack of visual parking space availability.

When road users are driving the visuals of the eye are limited, the
vision is blocked by many obstacles such as the cars frame causing blind
spots, other cars, trees and much more. It can be understood that the
road users can find it difficult to spot an available parking space if
it's in the distance or behind other cars. This has turned into an
important problem with road users and as a result they waist time and
fuel trying to spot an available space. (Ponnambalam, 2020)

Lack of knowledge of towns or cities.

Limerick is a city where people migrate to for education or tourism, and
with this brings more road users. When drivers first come to Limerick
City, they must learn the road routes and with this where the parking
is. A lot of road users that drive in a new place start to panic and get
anxious when they try and find parking. This can cause them to be in the
wrong lanes and cause traffic congestion. But with the Perfect Parking
app it will allow users to plan their route to the parking of their
choice and follow directions on the phone to the car park. By doing this
that it will keep new road users in the city calm so they can enjoy
their holiday or for students teach them the road routes and the best
places to park.

## Objectives

The Perfect Parking application aims to develop a user-friendly parking
system that utilizes object detection technology.

The envisioned app is a distributed application that leverages the power
of computer vision and client-server architecture working across the
internet. The app\'s goal is to illustrate the possibility and potential
of using computer vision technology to manage parking spaces more
efficiently. Perfect Parking uses a distributed strategy, using remote
clients equipped with cameras to capture images of parking spaces. These
clients use computer vision techniques to perform real-time image
processing and monitoring, sending the parking-occupancy (which
indicates whether a parking space is vacant or occupied) result to a
central server. Through this proof-of-concept application, Perfect
Parking showcases the benefits of distributed monitoring and computer
vision for effective parking space management.

The technology watches a video feed and allows the user to query for
parking spaces in parking areas. Once the parking monitor detects a
change to a parking space it pushes an update to the website with a
probability of parking being available. This application could be used
in parking lots and towns nationwide.

The objectives of this project solution are:

-   To provide a solution that can determine the status of the parking
    spots i.e., free or occupied.

-   To reduce the time motorists spend looking for parking in cities.

## The scope of the solution

The scope of the Perfect Parking solution includes both a model car park
made from cardboard and toy cars, and prerecorded video feeds, utilizing
a laptop and camera setup. In addition to showcasing the car detection
capabilities through prerecorded videos, a live feed option was
introduced using a camera and laptop to demonstrate the feasibility of
real-time video. Due to time and budget constraints, live feeds from
cities or colleges were not extensively integrated within the scope of
the project. Instead, prerecorded and model car park live feed remains a
primary method to illustrate the application\'s proficiency in detecting
available parking spaces. The solution also encompasses a server
demonstration, highlighting end-user interactions with the application
and its overall viability as a marketable product. By addressing these
key components, the solution\'s focus is refined, facilitating a more
concentrated and efficient development process**.**

It is estimated that it would take about 960 camera-feeds/clients to
comprehensively monitor the parking spots of Limerick City. The estimate
is derived from the assumption that a street like O'Connell St. will
need 2 to 3 camera-feeds/clients for one side of a street.

The calculations are:

-   A street needs 3 camera-feeds/clients.

-   A block has 4 sides i.e., 4 streets.

-   Total number of cameras per block: 12 cameras (3 cameras for 4
    streets)

-   Limerick has approximately 40 blocks of interest.

-   Total number of cameras: 480 cameras (12 cameras for 40 blocks)

It\'s important to note that the actual number of cameras required may
differ based on factors such as street layout, street parking allowed,
parking density, and camera coverage angles.

## The developed solution

The developed solution is an AI application to assist drivers finding
parking in busy cities. The applications are written in Python; The
server is built on Django framework and, the client use the OpenCV
library to achieve computer object detection. The source code for the
applications can be viewed at
<https://github.com/rhys-lit/perfect-parking-fyp> .

# Literature Review

A brief review of the literature about Parking monitor software, the
business sector, Big data/live, disturbing comped system and AI/Computer
vision

## Parking Business Sector

Parking management software is expected to see a compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) of 12.8% and expand to a global market size of \$11.3
billion by 2024. Additionally, it is anticipated that the market for
artificial intelligence (AI) in parking management will increase by 20%
yearly to \$1.5 billion by 2025. With these numbers in mind, it is
obvious that the parking sector needs creative solutions that can
harness the potential of AI to enhance parking management.

### Irish Trends

Statistics from the Central Statistics office (CSO) of Ireland gives
several suggestions that could encourage people to drive more in the
future. In the top three are traffic congestion, and access to parking.
(CSO.ie, 2019)

[]{#_Toc133573279 .anchor}Figure 2: CSO.ie - Factors that would
encourage more driving,

### Global Trends

The present approaches for locating parking spaces are inefficient and
wasteful, requiring a large amount of time and fuel. People spend an
average of 17 hours a year searching for parking spaces, according to
(McCoy, n.d.) and Irish people waste four days a year. (Sawer, 2017) the
solution intends to end this time and energy waste which will be
advantageous to both users and the environment.

It is anticipated that the global market for automated parking systems
will increase from \$1.3 billion in 2020 to \$3.6 billion in 2025. By
creating an AI-powered parking management system that can maximize
parking spot use, lessen traffic congestion, and more, the Perfect
Parking project seeks to meet this expanding need. and improve the
overall user experience for drivers. (abdalslam, 2023).

### Statistics

The utilization of statistics in modern technology has altered the way
we interact with our surroundings, especially in settings where
population density and activity levels can have a substantial impact on
decision-making. An example of this integration may be found in the
digital realm, where platforms such as Google utilize data to present
users with real-time information into the congestion and availability of
various businesses.

In such circumstances, the combination of statistics and technology
demonstrates the power of data-driven insights. As we progress into the
digital age, the refinement of algorithms and the integration of more
diverse data sources will most likely improve the accuracy of these
estimates, providing users with a valuable tool for efficiently planning
their activities and businesses with a way to better cater to their
customers\' needs.

## Real-time data

Real time data is data that is available as soon as its created and
acquired. The data is pushed to clients as soon as its collected and is
immediately available without delay. T this is crucial for supporting
live, in the moment decision making (Splunk, 2021). Parking Applications
need a large amount of live data to provide users with useable
information.

### The importance of Real-time data

Real-Time data is a necessity to stay relevant for today's business and
it needs to be delivered by sophisticated electronic communications
tools such as digital signage and data dashboards, to remain appealing
to today's tech savvy workforce from call centres to retailers.
(Barnett, 2017)

Real time data is important in many parking applications, these
applications use real-time data to show users if there is parking spaces
in the carpark which they have selected, this data can be gathered by
the carpark having a barrier that counts the amount of cars that go in
or the amount of cars that exit, some carparks also have sensors on each
of the parking spaces this allows users to see what actual spaces are
available, this is the most ideal as it allows people that need disabled
parking to see if that type of parking space is available.

### How Google collects and uses data

Google collects endless amounts of real time data. They use a device
that billions of people in the world have i.e., smart phones. (Turner,
2023). When people sign into google on their phone Google starts
creating real time data and transmitting in real time to google.

When looking for a business on Google basic information such as location
and opening hours is provided and data that indicates the company\'s
level of activity at various times of the day.

Google accomplishes this combination of data sources, which includes
real-time mobile device GPS position data, the user's query,
user-generated evaluations to create reliable estimates of how crowded a
location may be at any given time. (Reid, 2016)

Google using the saved data and statistical analysis can predict peak
hours of a business and thus potentially longer wait times by evaluating
patterns and trends from a wide range of data points. It can pinpoint
times when a site is less busy, providing users to avail of times with
shorter lines and a more convenient experience for consumers. This data
not only helps individuals make informed decisions about when to visit a
location, but it also allows businesses to optimize their operations,
staffing, and customer service methods based on anticipated traffic.

## Statistics and Big Data

A user wants to find parking for dinner this evening at 6 pm. Live data
does not exist for the future, but predictions can be made using
historical data. We looked at how Google collects large amounts of live
data and uses statistics to make predictions for shops. This large
amount of data is referred to as big data.

Big Data is a combination of structured, semi structured, and
unstructured data that is collected by organizations, this data can be
mined for information to be used in many projects such as machine
learning, predictive modelling, and other analytics applications. Big
Data is often characterized by the three Vs.

-   The large **Volume** of data in many environments.

-   The wide **Variety** of data types frequently stored in Big Data
    systems.

-   The **velocity** at which much of the data is generated, collected,
    and processed.

These characteristics were first identified in 2001 by Doug Laney, they
were then further popularized in 2005 by an analyst at a consulting firm
called Meta Group.

Big Data doesn't equate to any specific amount of data, Big Data
deployments often involve terabytes, petabytes or even in some cases
exabytes of data that is created and collected over time. (Botelho,
2020).

Big data refers to a wide range of digital sources that provide valuable
insights into human behaviour and preferences. Examples such as:

-   User browsing history provides web interactions and engagement
    patterns.

-   Search queries provide insights into information-seeking behaviours.

-   Emails reveals communication patterns.

### Why is Big Data important?

Big Data importance lies in the fact of how a company utilizes the
gathered data. Every company uses its gathered data in its own way, the
more a company can gather its data the more the company can grow.

Big Data provides valuable insights into customers that companies can
use to refine their marketing, advertising, and promotions by doing this
they can increase customer engagement and conversion rates. (TechVidan,
2022)

Big Data is huge in the medical industry, medical researchers can
identify disease signs and risk factors, this can help the doctors
diagnose illnesses and medical conditions in patients. A combination of
data from electronic health records and the web can give healthcare
organizations and government agencies up to date information on
infectious diseases threats or outbreaks, we have seen this in the past
with the pandemic and how the HSE in Ireland were able to monitor the
amount of covid -- 19 infections per county, and how they were able to
create the Covid App with this data. (Botelho, 2020)

### Problems with gathering data.

Collecting Big Data can be a challenging task that presents various
problems, irrespective of the domain or industry. The sheer amount of
data involved, which may be tiresome and challenging to handle, is one
of the main problems. Furthermore, the development and implementation of
the specialized tools and techniques needed for Big Data collection can
be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, because the data is
frequently gathered from a variety of sources, some of which might not
be trustworthy, ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data can be a
significant challenge. In addition, Big Data analysis and interpretation
can be challenging tasks that need for specialized knowledge and
abilities to spot patterns, trends, and insights. Addressing these
challenges effectively is critical to realizing the potential benefits
of Big Data, including improved decision-making, increased efficiency,
and enhanced innovation. (Sharma, 2022)

### Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development

The integration of data-driven insights from platforms such as Google
has become a useful tool in determining the need for new car parking
facilities within a city or locality in the realm of urban planning and
infrastructure development. The abundance of information collected and
made available to users via such platforms not only assists individual
decision-making but also provides a complete overview of traffic
patterns and congestion levels, which can inform larger-scale urban
planning projects.

Data offered by platforms such as Google, particularly real-time
information on company activity, provides insight into the dynamics of
urban mobility and the need for parking spots. When aggregated over time
and across multiple sites, this data can reveal major trends and
patterns in parking demand. This data can be used by urban planners and
city officials to identify places that typically experience high
congestion and low parking availability.

In turn, the data can reveal situations when existing parking
infrastructure is underutilized. If specific places continually display
low traffic levels and plenty of parking, it may imply that the present
parking facilities are properly fulfilling the needs of the community.
In such instances, investing in new car parking structures may not be a
high-priority activity, allowing city planners to more effectively
allocate resources to other important urban development initiatives.

## Computer Vision

Computer vision is a multifaceted field of study aimed at training
computers how to interpret and process visual information from images or
videos. It entails the creation of algorithms and approaches for
extracting useful insights from visual data. (Simplilearn, 2023). In the
context of the proposed Parking application Computer vision can detect
the presence of vehicle in a parking spot in real-time by utilizing
image processing, pattern recognition, and feature extraction.

### Applications of Computer Vision

Computer vision has a wide range of applications across various
industries. Some notable applications include:

-   **Object Detection and Recognition**: Computer vision algorithms can
    identify and classify objects within images or video streams. This
    technology is used in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and
    facial recognition systems.

-   **Augmented Reality**: Computer vision enables the overlay of
    digital information onto the real world, enhancing user experiences
    in areas such as gaming, advertising, and training simulations.

-   **Medical Imaging:** Computer vision techniques assist in medical
    image analysis, aiding in the detection and diagnosis of diseases,
    as well as in surgical planning and monitoring.

-   **Quality Control and Inspection**: Computer vision can automate
    quality control processes by identifying defects or anomalies in
    products on assembly lines, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

-   **Robotics and Automation**: Computer vision plays a vital role in
    robotics, enabling robots to perceive and understand their
    environment, navigate autonomously, and interact with objects and
    humans. **(needs Citation)**

### Object Recognition and AI

Object recognition refers to the process of teaching a computer how to
identify and classify objects within digital images or videos. It\'s
like teaching a child to recognize different objects such as cars,
chairs, or animals. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the field of
computer science that deals with creating machines that can perform
tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning,
reasoning, and problem-solving. AI techniques like deep learning, which
is a subset of machine learning, are often used in object recognition
systems to train algorithms to recognize and classify objects. This
technology has a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to
medical diagnosis to robotics. (Tech Target, n.d.)

Object detection is a technique in computer vision that involves
detecting objects of interest within an image or video stream. Finding
objects within a picture and categorizing them into various categories
are the goals of object detection. Since object detection requires
locating and recognizing multiple objects inside a picture, it is a more
advanced technique than object recognition (Patel, 2020).

### Cascading classifiers

Cascade classifiers One kind of machine learning technique used in
computer vision for object detection is called a cascading classifier.
In their groundbreaking study \"Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted
Cascade of Simple Features\" published in 2001, Viola and Jones
introduced them for the first time. The approach is based on the concept
of \"cascading\" the solution of a complex detection problem into
several smaller, easier sub-problems. (Michael Jones, 2001)

The basic idea behind cascading classifiers is to use a series of
classifiers, each with increasing complexity, to detect objects of
interest. Utilizing a series of classifiers, each with a higher level of
complexity, to find things of interest is the main notion underlying
cascading classifiers. The input image is classified as either
containing the object of interest or not by each classifier in the
cascade using a collection of features. Each classifier\'s attributes
are chosen based on their capacity to distinguish between positive and
negative samples. (Lee, 2022)

One of the main advantages of cascading classifiers is their ability to
achieve high detection rates with low false positive rates. This is
accomplished by employing several classifiers, each of which is trained
to quickly reject negative samples. As a result, there are fewer false
positives because the algorithm can swiftly reject pictures that don\'t
include the object of interest. (Bąk, 2023)

When used in object detection tasks like face detection, cascading
classifiers have been shown to be highly accurate and effective. (Bąk,
2023).

### The background of Classifiers (Haar-like features)

Classifiers are based upon Haar wavelets theory using Haar-like
features, which are extracted from images using rectangular filters and
then fed into a classifier to learn to distinguish between different
classes based on the extracted features.

An image feature type used in computer vision for object detection is
called a Haar-like feature. They have the name of the Haar wavelet,
which Alfred Haar, a Hungarian mathematician, initially proposed in
1909. (Seal, n.d.) The mathematical function known as the Haar wavelet
can be used to break down a signal or image into a collection of wavelet
coefficients.

By comparing the average pixel values in adjacent rectangular regions of
an image, Haar-like features can be extracted from the Haar wavelet. The
difference between the sum of pixel intensities in a rectangular region
with a light color and the sum of pixel intensities in a rectangle
region with a dark color is the precise definition of Haar-like features
(Arunachalam, 2014).

These rectangular areas can be positioned anywhere in the image and come
in a variety of sizes and shapes. It is feasible to gather details about
the texture and structure of a picture at various levels of granularity
by computing Haar-like features at various scales and positions in the
image.

A Haar Cascade Classifier basically works by detecting features in an
image that are characteristic of the object to be scanned for, such as
edges, corners, and lines. These features are then used to classify the
object.

Haar Cascade Classifiers can be trained to recognize specific objects,
such as faces, eyes, and cars, and the code is able to detect and
localize these objects within an image.

The Viola-Jones object detection technique, a well-liked algorithm for
face detection in photos, makes use of Haar-like features. In this
approach, a classifier is trained to differentiate between positive
instances (pictures containing the item of interest, such as faces) and
negative examples (images devoid of the object of interest), using a set
of Haar-like characteristics computed for each sub-region of an input
image. (Tyagi, 2021)

One of the advantages of using Haar-like features for object detection
is their computational efficiency. They are suitable for real-time
applications like video surveillance since they are rapid and effective
to compute utilizing integral images. (Bąk, 2023)

### Future implications of Computer Vision in Parking Systems

The use of computer vision techniques in parking systems has significant
implications for parking management in the future. Parking systems can
become more efficient, user-friendly, and automated with the use of
computer vision algorithms. Aside from detecting car park occupancy,
computer vision can be used for actions such as license plate
recognition, vehicle tracking, and advanced parking analytics. Computer
vision in parking systems can simplify parking operations, maximize
space utilization, minimize congestion, and improve overall user
experience. As computer vision technology advances, it will most
certainly disrupt the parking sector and open the door for creative
parking solutions. (brouton Lab, n.d.)

## Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a networked collection of autonomous entities
(such as computers or devices) that collaborate to achieve a common goal
or perform a particular task. Unlike a centralized system, in which all
processing and decision-making takes place within a single entity, a
distributed system divides and distributes the workload across entities
over a large area.

Each entity in a distributed system, known as a node or client,
functions independently and can communicate with other client nodes or a
server on a network. These nodes can be distributed geographically and
have varying capabilities and rolls within the system. By leveraging the
collective resources and capabilities of multiple nodes, a distributed
system can achieve higher scalability, fault tolerance, and performance
compared to a centralized system. (S.Gillis, 2022)

[]{#_Toc142913784 .anchor}Figure 4: Distributed Clients communicating
with a server on a Star Network

[A distributed application, is a form of distributed system that focuses
on providing functionality or services to end users. It includes the
software components, communication protocols, and architectural design
that allow the application to run in a distributed fashion. Distributed
apps exploit the distributed nature of the underlying local
hardware/recourses to handle large-scale data processing, concurrent
user interactions, and complicated computations.]{.mark} [(Lutkevich,
2022)]{.mark}

The use of distributed systems and apps has grown in popularity in a
variety of fields, including e-commerce, social networks, cloud
computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems have
advantages such as higher availability, fault tolerance, and
scalability, allowing for more efficient resource utilization and
improved performance. (Cirrus, 2018)

In the context of the Perfect Parking app, the distributed system/app
architecture allows for the seamless integration of multiple client apps
equipped with cameras and a central server. [The distributed system/app
design allows for the smooth integration of many client applications
equipped with cameras and a central server in the context of the Perfect
Parking app. This distributed strategy provides efficient monitoring and
management of parking spaces across multiple locations by leveraging the
client apps\' combined computing capacity while centralizing data
storage and analysis.]{.mark}

[Perfect Parking seeks to improve scalability, fault tolerance, and
real-time monitoring capabilities by incorporating distributed system
principles and utilizing distributed apps. The app\'s distributed design
enables effective utilization of local resources and seamless
cooperation of many entities, thereby boosting the overall (coverage)
functionality and performance of the parking management system.]{.mark}

A Server REST API allows clients apps to provide updates to the server
across the internet.

### RESTful APIs

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
Interface) is a design style and set of constraints used for developing
online services that allow systems to communicate and interact with one
another via the internet. RESTful APIs are built on the REST concepts
introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in the year
2000. These APIs enable the seamless interaction between distributed
components, offering a standardized approach for accessing and
manipulating resources.

Resources in a RESTful API are identified by unique URLs (Uniform
Resource Locators), and standard HTTP methods such as GET (retrieve
data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (delete data)
are employed to manipulate these resources. The key characteristics of a
RESTful API include being stateless, having a uniform interface,
following a client-server architecture, using self-descriptive messages,
and incorporating HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application
State) to guide clients through state transitions.

### Benefits and Use Cases of Restful APIs

Restful APIs offer numerous advantages for web and mobile application
development. They provide simplicity through their straightforward
design, using conventional HTTP methods for ease of implementation.
Additionally, they support scalability, enabling applications to
efficiently handle increased traffic by distributing requests across
servers. The ease of integration is another benefit, as Restful APIs
utilize widely recognized web standards like HTTP and JSON, promoting
compatibility across various platforms and languages.

Restful APIs find application in various domains. They are crucial for
social media integration, enabling sharing and user authentication
services. E-commerce websites use them to manage product catalogues and
process orders, while mapping providers leverage Restful APIs for
location-based services. On the Internet of Things (IoT), these APIs
facilitate communication between devices and cloud platforms,
contributing to smart home and industrial automation applications.

### Role of REST APIs in Distributed Applications

REST APIs play a pivotal role in enabling seamless communication and
interaction between distributed components within applications. Founded
on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), these APIs
provide a standardized and scalable approach for developing distributed
online applications.

Key advantages of REST APIs include a standardized interface for
client-server communication, statelessness which simplifies request
processing, decoupling of components for flexibility and scalability,
distributed data and resource access through HTTP methods, and support
for integration and interoperability with external systems.

By leveraging RESTful APIs, Perfect Parking achieves efficient
communication, data exchange, and collaboration among its distributed
components. The RESTful API acts as a bridge, allowing the app to
harness the web\'s capabilities for constructing scalable,
interoperable, and robust distributed applications.

## A Software Solution

By leveraging the latest technologies and market trends, the Perfect
Parking project seeks to revolutionize the parking industry and provide
a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by parking operators
and drivers alike.

In this project, the parking application is being created for
educational purposes to solve the widespread parking issue in our
cities. Time is lost, gasoline is consumed, and traffic is backed up due
to Limerick City\'s old and inefficient parking systems. To increase the
efficiency of identifying parking spaces and reduce the stress
experienced by users searching for parking spaces, a new and creative
software solution is required.

The lack of obvious availability of parking spaces is another issue with
the present parking schemes. Due to the limited vision created by
numerous obstructions like the car\'s frame, trees, or other vehicles,
drivers frequently struggle to find an open parking place. Users now
spend much more time and fuel because of this issue.

Furthermore, for new road users, finding parking spaces in a new place
can be a challenging task. In Limerick City, students and tourists come
from different regions to study or visit, and they must learn the road
routes and where the parking is. This lack of knowledge can cause them
to be in the wrong lanes and create traffic congestion. However, by
providing users with the option to plan their route to the parking of
their choice and follow directions on their phones to the car park, the
application can help users navigate the city\'s roads and reduce traffic
congestion.

To conclude, there is a pressing need for a software solution to address
the problems associated with parking in our cities. Perfect Parking aims
to provide a solution that is innovative, effective, and user-friendly,
with the potential to reduce time and fuel consumption, improve traffic
flow, and create a stress-free parking experience for all road users.

## Agile Software Development Paradigm

Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes
flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. Agile development
teams divide the work into smaller, more manageable chunks called
\"sprints\" rather than working on a project in a linear fashion with a
precise plan set in stone from the beginning. A working prototype or
product increment that can be tested and evaluated is produced by each
sprint, which lasts typically two to four weeks. Agile development
promotes regular communication and collaboration between team members
and stakeholders and favours working software over documentation. The
Agile manifesto identifies four basic values: valuing people over
processes and technologies, emphasizing working software over thorough
documentation, prioritizing communication with customers over contract
negotiations, and reacting to change over planning ahead. (atlassian,
n.d.)

# Analysis and Design

Parking is an issue that contributes to traffic congestion, especially
in cities. Cars driving around and around a city for parking adds to the
traffic. Cars hovering for parking spots or cars double parked can cause
traffic to stop. The purpose of perfect parking is to try and solve the
common problem of traffic congestion and scarcity of parking in a city
such as Limerick. Perfect parking aims to ease the stress and anxiety
that road users face searching for parking by providing live data about
availability, pricing, stay-hours, zones, and disability status.
Additional benefits include reducing traffic congestion, fuel savings,
time and reducing stress.

## Providing Website and Real-Time Services

This subsection delves into the architectural analysis and design
considerations of the Perfect Parking web application. It investigates
Django\'s contribution to delivering the website and explains how the
website functions as a service for end users looking for real-time
parking space availability information. This analysis provides insights
into the underlying technology and design principles that contribute to
the Perfect Parking application\'s user-friendliness and efficiency.

### Providing the website using Django

Django, a high-level Python web framework, plays an important role in
providing the web-based application to users. Its reliable architecture
makes developing and deploying web applications easier. In the context
of this project, Django acts as the server-side framework responsible
for handling user requests and delivering the Perfect Parking website.

Here\'s a rundown of how Django is utilized to provide the website:

### Web Application Architecture

The architecture of the Perfect Parking web application is built on
Django\'s Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, also known as
Model-View-Template (MVT) in Django. This architecture ensures a clear
separation of concerns, making it easier to manage the application\'s
various components.

### Model Creation and Database Management

The heart of the Perfect Parking web application\'s database structure
is defined within the models.py class using Django\'s Object-Relational
Mapping (ORM) system. This class defines the attributes and structure of
the database tables, including parking lots and monitors. For instance,
the ParkingLot model encapsulates crucial details such as name, address,
hours, and availability. Similarly, the ParkingLotMonitor model
represents monitor data, including location, availability probability,
and last update timestamp.

### User Request Handling

When a user accesses the website, their request is routed through
Django\'s URL dispatcher. This dispatcher maps the URL to a specific
view function that will process the request.

### View Functions and Templates

Python view functions handle the processing of user requests. They
interact with the models of the application to retrieve data, perform
calculations, and generate dynamic content. The view functions render
templates once the processing is complete.

### Templates for Dynamic Content

Templates are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic content. These
templates are populated with data from the view functions and are
responsible for generating the final HTML that is sent to the user\'s
browser.

### Rendering the Response

Django\'s template engine renders the dynamic content into HTML,
creating a complete response. This response is then sent to the user\'s
browser, which interprets and displays the content.

## Providing a Service to the End User

The Perfect Parking website is designed to provide an efficient and
user-friendly service to end users seeking real-time information on
parking space availability. Here\'s how the website serves the end user:

### Real-Time Parking Space Availability

The website allows users to initiate a search for available parking
spaces within Limerick City and will show the user the distance in
kilometres to the parking lots. Users are presented with a \"Search Near
Me\" button, which triggers the geolocation retrieval and data query
process.

### Geolocation Retrieval and Query

Upon clicking the \"Search Near Me\" button, the website retrieves the
user\'s current geolocation through JavaScript. The obtained latitude
and longitude coordinates are sent to the server to query carpark
monitor data within the specified radius.

### Probability Calculation and Presentation

The server processes the carpark monitor data and calculates the
probability of parking space availability for each carpark. The results
are dynamically presented in a table format on the website.

### User Friendly Interface

The website has an easy-to-use layout that allows users to readily
interpret the results. The table provides useful details such as
car-park names, addresses, operating hours, and the probability of
parking availability.

### Real Time Updates

As users interact with the website, it dynamically updates the table
based on their location to the carpark and how busy the carpark is. This
real-time update ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date
information.

In summary, Django serves as the backbone of the Perfect Parking web
application, facilitating the delivery of the website to users. The
website offers an easy-to-use service, leveraging geolocation and
dynamic data processing to provide real-time parking space availability
information, thereby enhancing parking management and user convenience.
The model creation using the models**.**py class defines the database
structure, supporting seamless data management and interaction with the
application\'s backend.

## Real-Time Communication and Parking Data Updates: REST API Integration

This subsection delves into the intricacies of integrating the car-park
camera monitoring API within the Perfect Parking system. It explores how
the REST architecture facilitates communication between client
applications (parking monitors) and the server, leading to real-time
updates of parking data. This analysis sheds light on the efficiency and
reliability of the communication process, ensuring accurate parking
availability information for end users.

### Car-Park Camera Monitoring API and Communication via REST

The car-park camera monitoring API forms a crucial link in the Perfect
Parking system, enabling seamless communication between the client
applications, representing the parking monitors, and the server. This
communication occurs through the utilization of the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

### REST Communication Principles

REST offers a standardized approach for exchanging data between
distributed systems. In the context of Perfect Parking, the car-park
camera monitoring API follows the principles of REST to ensure efficient
and scalable communication:

-   **Resource-Based Interaction:** Each monitored parking lot is
    treated as a resource, identified by a unique URL. For instance, a
    parking lot monitor can be accessed via its own URL, and actions
    like updating its status or availability can be triggered using
    standard HTTP methods like POST, PUT, or DELETE.

-   **Statelessness**: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each
    request from a client to the server must contain all necessary
    information to process the request. This simplifies server
    management and supports scalability.

-   **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs adhere to a consistent set of
    methods and resource identifiers (URLs). This uniformity enhances
    interoperability and allows different clients to interact with the
    server using the same conventions.

### Client-Server Interaction

The client applications, which represent the carpark monitors, initiate
communication with the server using RESTful endpoints. These endpoints
correspond to specific functionalities related to parking data updates.
For instance:

-   The client application can send a POST request to update the
    availability status of parking spaces as cars enter or exit.

-   A PUT request can be utilized to update the probability of parking
    availability, calculated based on real-time data analysis.

### Parking Data Updates

During this communication, the clients update various parking data
attributes on the server:

-   **Availability Status**: As vehicles enter or leave parking spaces,
    the car-park monitors send data to the server, updating the status
    of each parking spot. The server interprets these updates and
    adjusts the availability status accordingly.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Probability Calculation**: The clients periodically send data
    related to occupancy, which the server uses to calculate the
    probability of available parking spaces. This dynamic probability is
    then communicated back to users in real-time through the website.

### Real Time Updates and Reliability

The RESTful communication between clients and the server ensures that
the parking data is consistently updated, maintaining the accuracy and
reliability of the information presented to users. This real-time
interaction enables users to access current parking availability
probabilities, enhancing their decision-making process.

In summary, the car-park camera monitoring client API implements RESTful
communication principles to facilitate a robust connection between
itself and the server. Through this connection, real-time parking data
updates are seamlessly transmitted, ensuring the accuracy of the
information presented to users on the website. This architecture
supports the overall goal of providing users with real-time insights
into parking availability.

## Automated Real-Time Parking Detection

The Parking Monitor clients monitor the car parks registered in the
database. This network of client applications will use advanced video
processing capabilities, powered by the OpenCV library to autonomously
identify parking spaces within the video footage to declare if the
parking spots are available or occupied.

### Seamless Integration and Centralized Updates

Real-time data updates and occupancy changes are automatically pushed to
the server allowing for smooth integration with the Perfect Parking
application. This centralized data flow ensures that the server receives
real-time updates on parking space availability.

## Utilizing Computer Vision in Perfect Parking

Cameras deployed within the car park capture video in real-time. The
Perfect Parking monitor application will use OpenCV to detect a car park
spot's occupancy by analysing video frames. The monitor application
continuously monitors the car park and provide up-to-date information on
parking space availability to the server.

## The Client Application

The client application monitors the video feed of a parking lots across
a city and provides live updates to the Perfect Parking website once a
change in the car park is detected such as a spot becomes available or
occupied.

### Image Processing: Identifying a parking space's occupancy.

To accomplish this goal, the client application will use image
processing to identify if a car parking space is free or busy. If the
client detects a change, it will send updated data to the server.

## Application Database design

The database for this project comprises three tables: \"User\",
\"ParkingLotMonitor\", and \"ParkingLot\". Login information for users
of the parking application is kept in the \"User\" table. The
\"ParkingLot\" table keeps records of each parking lot\'s name, address,
image, operating hours, and method of payment while the
\"ParkingLotMonitor\" table keeps track of parking availability for
monitored car parks. The \"ParkingLotMonitor\" table is linked to the
\"ParkingLot\" table through the \"ParkingLotId\" column to enable the
parking application to track parking availability at each location.

[]{#_Toc132726762 .anchor}Figure 8- User Parking Sequence Diagram

This is the sequence diagram of the process where a user is searching
for parking near their location using the application. The user asks the
app if there is parking available near their GPS location on Henry
Street.

To check if parking is available in each lot the software queries
multiple parking lot monitors:

-   Henry St Parking Lot Monitor

-   O' Connell Street Parking Lot Monitor

-   Merchants Quay Parking Lot Monitor

-   Barrington Street Parking Lot Monitor

-   St. Johns Parking Lot Monitor

The Henry St Parking Lot Monitor responds that parking is 97% available,
O'Connell Street Parking Lot Monitor responds 87%, Merchants Quay
Parking Lot Monitor 65%, Barrington Street Parking Lot Monitor 45%. And
St. Johns Parking Lot Monitor 75%

Finally, the application then sends a response to the user indicating
that there are 5 parking lots available near their location, with the
names The Henry St, O'Connell Street, Merchants Quay, Barrington Street.

## Technologies

The following section explores a range of technologies and assesses
their relevance for implementation within the project.

### Computer Vision: OpenCV

Machine learning is a key component of the application as it will be
used to identify if a car parking space is free or busy. The powerful
library OpenCV provides a wide range of features for computer vision
applications. It is widely used across many different industries,
including robotics, driverless cars, medical imaging, and
more.\[refencer\]

Image filtering, feature detection, object recognition, and tracking are
just a few of the techniques that OpenCV offers to process and analyze
visual data. (Boesch, 2023)

Several pre-trained cascading classifiers, including the well-known Haar
cascades for face detection, are available in OpenCV for object
detection. A parking monitor app powered by OpenCV will be used to
detect if a parking spot has been filled or made empty, further
improving the effectiveness of the system.

The machine learning algorithm will be trained using data collected from
the sensors (video camera). The machine learning algorithm will then be
used to identify if a car parking space is free or busy.

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a popular distribution of the Python programming language
that is widely used for data science and scientific computing. It comes
with a sizable number of pre-installed libraries and tools that are
frequently used in these domains, including Jupyter Notebook, NumPy,
Pandas, and Matplotlib. (Root, 2020)

Anaconda is designed to make it easy to set up and manage Python
environments, which are essentially separate installations of Python
with their own dependencies and libraries. When working on several
projects with various requirements, this is especially helpful because
it enables you to keep them separate from one another. (Root, 2020)

The Conda package manager, which lets you easily install, update, and
manage additional software packages and libraries, is included with
Anaconda in addition to Python and its libraries. When working with
non-Python libraries that are necessary for your project, this can be
helpful. (McKinney, 2022)

Utilising Anaconda has several benefits, one of which is how much easier
it makes it to set up a Python environment for data research or
scientific computing. It removes the need to individually install and
configure each library, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone
operation, by offering a pre-built distribution with many of the
frequently used libraries already installed. (O Reilly, n.d.)

Overall, Anaconda is a robust and adaptable tool that is well-liked by
those who work in data research and scientific computing. Researchers,
developers, and data analysts all favour it because of how simple it is
to use and the extensive library of tools that are already installed.

### Django Rest API

Django is a popular web development framework that is written in Python.
It provides a set of tools and features that make it easy to build
complex web applications quickly and efficiently. Django was created by
Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison in 2005, it features a vast
collection of classes, libraries and modules that can be implemented in
individual projects. With Django, you can create web applications that
follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which helps to
separate the different components of your application and make it easier
to manage. Additionally, Django comes with a lot of built-in
functionality, including an ORM for database interactions, an admin
interface for managing site content, and a templating system for
rendering HTML pages. Overall, Django is a powerful and flexible
framework that is well-suited for building all kinds of web
applications. (Johnson, n.d.)

## The Website

Perfect Parking is a web application that will allow users to search for
parking in a city.

The application will allow users to search for parking near a specific
location and will show the user data the nearest parking to their
location.

The web application allows the user to access real time data on parking
space availability in multiple carparks and shows the user the distance
to each car park in the database. Here is how the system works.

1.  **Geolocation Retrieval:** When a user accesses the web application,
    the system utilizes JavaScript to retrieve the user\'s current
    geolocation (latitude and longitude) through the browser\'s
    geolocation service this is triggered once the user clicks the
    "Search Near Me" button on the Parking lot page.

2.  **Data Query and Processing:** Upon clicking the \"Search Near Me\"
    button, the web application queries a server-side backend or API to
    obtain carpark monitor data within the specified radius from the
    user\'s location.

3.  **Probability Calculation:** The received carpark monitor data is
    processed to calculate the probability of parking space availability
    in each car-park. The system determines the likelihood of finding an
    available parking spot based on the data obtained from the carpark
    monitors i.e., how many spots are free or occupied.

4.  ~~**Real-Time Updates:** The web application automatically updates
    the table on the web page to display the probability of parking
    spaces available in each carpark. The table includes relevant
    details such as the car-park name, address, hours of operation, and
    whether it is a paid parking area.~~

5.  **User-Friendly Presentation:** The web application presents the
    results in a user-friendly format, allowing users to easily view and
    compare parking space availability in various carparks and shows the
    distance to each carpark so the user can verify which carpark is
    more convenient.

To conclude, the web application provides users with real-time
information into parking space availability, allowing them to make
decisions when searching for a parking lot. The system enhances the
parking management efficiency and user convenience, contributing to a
smoother parking experience in urban areas.

# Implementation

## Project Management

During the time doing the final year project weekly supervisor meetings
were held. These meetings were very useful for asking questions, and
keeping the project on track, the supervisor was very supportive and
gave great feedback when it was needed to ensure that the project was
kept on track. With his guidance and great knowledge, it allowed the
Perfect Parking application to be completed with a high standard and
within a timely manner.

### Source Control and versioning

For source control and versioning, GitHub was utilized to manage the
codebase for the project. GitHub was chosen because of prior experience
using it during other studies, and it provided a reliable platform for
version control and collaboration with the supervisor. It allows for
easy upkeep and to keep track of changes made during each week and
easily roll back to previous versions if needed.

Additionally, the supervisor was added as a collaborator on the
repository, allowing him to view the progress and provide feedback on
the code and documents. This facilitated effective communication and
ensured that the project was aligned with the objectives.

One significant advantage of using GitHub was that it provided a safe
and secure backup of the code. In the event of file corruption, it would
be possible to pull down the last push request and continue the work
without losing progress.

### Tools Used

Python: An interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
with dynamic semantics.

Libraries and Frameworks:

-   Django web framework, which allowed for rapid development of the
    application website/server and easy maintenance.

-   OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software
    library, which was used for image processing and analysis.

Tools:

-   VS Code: A lightweight code editor with support for many languages
    and debugging.

-   Anaconda: a package management, and deployment tool to install and
    manage required libraries and dependencies.

-   Microsoft Word: used to write the documentation.

-   Canva: a graphic design platform used to create the project poster.

-   Mermaid.live: used to create markdown diagrams.

By utilizing these tools, languages, and frameworks, the project was
completed more efficiently, with greater accuracy and precision.

### How to Install Anaconda

-   Download the Appropriate Anaconda installer from the [Anaconda
    Website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

-   Open VS Code and open a new terminal window by selecting
    \"Terminal\" from the top menu and then selecting \"New Terminal.

-   Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Anaconda
    installer using the command **cd \<directory\>**.

-   Follow the instructions in the Anaconda installer to complete the
    installation process.

-   Once the installation is complete, you can use Anaconda in the VS
    Code terminal by activating the Anaconda environment with the
    command **conda activate**. You can then use the various Anaconda
    packages and tools in the terminal as needed.

-   For example, if you want to use the Pandas library in your Python
    script, you can first activate the Anaconda environment by typing
    the following command in the terminal:

> 1\.     conda activate

-   Then, you can import the Pandas library in your Python script using
    the following line of code:

> 1\.     import pandas as pd

-   This will allow you to use the various functions and methods
    provided by the Pandas library in your project.

## How Object Recognition works in Perfect Parking clients

The Perfect Parking Server receives parking status data from client
applications. A client monitor app is responsible for processing video
and determining if parking is available. A proof-of-concept project by
Olga Rocheeva was sourced on GitHub and built upon to work with Perfect
Parking (Rocheeva, 2018).

## Implementation of Car-Park Monitoring and Data Reporting using REST API

This section provides an in-depth insight into the practical
implementation of the client application responsible for carpark
monitoring. The client application\'s core functionality is to detect
parking space availability and communicate this data to the central
server using a REST API.

The client application, known as PerfectParkingClient, encapsulates
crucial classes that enable the monitoring and reporting of parking
spaces:

-   ParkingMonitorData: This class stores key parking monitor data. It
    receives configuration data from a file and stores attributes such
    as the ID, name, position, parking spots, and authentication
    credentials of the monitor.

-   RestApiUtility: This class is essential for providing updates to the
    central server over the REST API. It creates and transmits PUT
    requests containing updated parking monitor data, such as the number
    of available parking spaces and the probability of parking
    availability.

-   ParkingSpot: This class represents individual parking spaces,
    recording their coordinates as well as their occupancy state. Based
    on visual processing, it determines whether a parking space is
    occupied.

-   MotionDetector: This class manages the monitoring of parking spaces.
    It detects the occupancy state of each parking spot in a video feed
    using image processing algorithms. When the parking occupancy
    changes, the RestApiUtility sends the information to the central
    server.

The process involves capturing a video feed, processing frames to
determine parking spot occupancy, and then reporting the number of
available spaces and parking availability probability to the server
through the REST API.

Furthermore, the communication with the server utilizes the
update_server_parking_monitor_data method of the RestApiUtility class.
This method constructs a JSON object with the relevant parking monitor
data, encapsulates it within a PUT request, and sends it to the server.
The server responds with the outcome of the update.

Real-time parking space monitoring and reporting are made possible by
seamlessly integrating the client application with the server via
RESTful communication, resulting in an accurate and up-to-date parking
availability display for end users.

## Implementation of Perfect Parking Web Application

The Perfect Parking web application is developed using the Django
framework, enabling the creation of a robust parking management system.
This application acts as a hub for users to access real-time parking
information and monitor the availability of parking spaces in multiple
parking lots.

### Model Based Data Management

The data structure of the application is designed using Django\'s
model-driven architecture. The application defines two key classes in
the models.py file: ParkingLot and ParkingLotMonitor. The ParkingLot
class contains information about parking lots such as their name,
address, hours of operation, and available parking spaces. The
ParkingLotMonitor class, on the other hand, contains information about
the parking lot monitors, such as parking availability probability, and
status.

### User Friendly Interface

The Perfect Parking application\'s front-end was designed to be simple
and easy to use. Users can easily interact with the web
application by web browsers. When users use the app, they are met with
an interactive interface that displays real-time parking information.

### Views and Templates

To successfully present data to users, the application takes advantage
of Django\'s views and templates. Views, which are implemented as Python
functions, handle incoming HTTP requests and generate appropriate
responses The user interface is rendered using templates, which are
structured as HTML files with placeholders for dynamic data.

The views of the application retrieve data from the models and send it
to templates for rendering. For example, a view could query the database
to get information about available parking lots and the monitoring
devices that go with them. This data is then organized and sent to
templates to sgenerate user-readable output.

### Real time Data Integration

The application\'s real-time data update approach is one of its most
notable features. This is done by frequent interactions with parking lot
monitors\' REST APIs. These APIs provide the most recent parking
availability data. This data is processed by the application\'s views,
which dynamically update the user interface to reflect changes in
parking status.

### User Query Tracking

The application also tracks user queries and interactions. When users
search for parking lots based on specific geographic coordinates, these
queries are logged and stored in the database. This feature not only
enhances user experience but also provides valuable insights into user
preferences and trends.

### Implementation Highlights

The Perfect Parking web application implementation demonstrates the use
of Django\'s models for structured data management. The user interface
is simple to use, and templates dynamically render real-time data. The
application keeps users informed about parking space availability by
interacting with REST APIs. Furthermore, the system logs user inquiries,
providing a detailed view of user behaviour.

## The Client App

### ParkingLot by Rocheeva

The project ParkingLot pre-processes an image by first blurring and then
grey scaling the image to reduce noise to improve the accuracy of
parking spot occupancy detection.

1\. def detect_motion(self)-\>bool:

2\.     #\...

3\.     free_spaces: int = 0

4\.     while True:

5\.         #\...

6\.         is_open, video_frame = video_capture.read()

7\.         #\...

8\.         blurred = GaussianBlur(video_frame.copy(), (5, 5), 3)

9\.         grayed_image: Mat = cvtColor(blurred, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

10\.  

11\.         for parking_spot in self.parking_spots:

12\.            
parking_spot.determine_and_mark_occupancy_from_image(grayed_image)

13\.  

The programme overlays the designated parking spaces onto the video,
initialising them as available or occupied depending on the presence of
cars.

1\. def display_image(self, video_frame:Mat):

2\.     for parking_spot in self.parking_spots:

3\.         color:tuple = COLOR_GREEN if parking_spot.is_occupied else
COLOR_BLUE

4\.         parking_spot_text:str = str(parking_spot.parking_spot_id)

5\.         draw_contours(video_frame, parking_spot.coordinates,
parking_spot_text, COLOR_WHITE, color)

6\.     imshow(str(self.video), video_frame)

7\.  

#### How a parking space status is determined

The code can identify when a car is present in a location by analyzing
the average pixel intensity within the marked area and comparing it to a
threshold value. A location is regarded as available if the average
intensity is below the threshold value and seen as occupied if it is
above the threshold.

The function determine_and_mark_occupancy_from_image() in
motion_detector.py is responsible for determining if the status of
parking spaces. The Laplacian operator helps enhance and emphasize edges
and intensity variations in an image aiding in detecting features and
boundaries.

1\. def determine_and_mark_occupancy_from_image(self,
blurred_grayed_image:Mat):

2\.     x, y, width, height = self.rect

3\.  

4\.     parking_spot_image:Mat = blurred_grayed_image\[y:(y + height),
x:(x + width)\]

5\.     laplacian = cv2.Laplacian(parking_spot_image, cv2.CV_64F)

6\.  

7\.     laplacian_mean: float = numpy.mean(numpy.abs(laplacian \*
self.mask))

8\.     self.is_occupied = laplacian_mean \<
MotionDetector.LAPLACIAN_UPPER_LIMIT

In the context of the code, it assists in determining the occupancy of a
parking space by analysing the intensity changes within a region of
interest. The contours, on the other hand, help create a mask that
represents the detected object\'s boundary, which can be useful for
further analysis and segmentation.

1\.     def create_contours_mask(self)-\>list:

2\.         new_coordinates = self.coordinates.copy()

3\.  

4\.         x, y, width, height = self.rect

5\.         new_coordinates\[:, 0\] = self.coordinates\[:, 0\] - x

6\.         new_coordinates\[:, 1\] = self.coordinates\[:, 1\] - y

7\.  

8\.         contours:list = drawContours(

9\.             numpy.zeros((height, width), dtype=numpy.uint8),

10\.             \[new_coordinates\],

11\.             contourIdx=-1,

12\.             color=255,

13\.             thickness=-1,

14\.             lineType=cv2.LINE_8)

15\.  

16\.         contours = contours == 255

17\.         return contours

#### A quick note on source code quality

The function detectmotion() has Cognitive Complexity value of 33 well
above the allowed 15 according to sonarlint (Sonar Rules, n.d.) and
refactoring the function is recommended. Also, the code seems to lack a
consistent intuitive naming convention coupled with a sever lack of much
needed comments.

sample config.ini

-   A Plain Old Common Object (POCO) ParkingMonitorData class was added
    to hold data about a parking lot monitor i.e., A Parking Lot
    Monitor's Id, Name, Latitude, Longitude, Number of Parking Spaces,
    and the App's Authentication Token, Username, Password, and the
    Server's URL. The ParkingMonitorData class uses Config Parser to
    load the Parking Lot Monitor's data from config files keeping best
    practices of separating sensitive data from the source code.

## Perfect Parking with Django

The Perfect Parking application was created using the popular web
framework Django for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, Django is a high-level web framework that follows the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which promotes code
organization and separation of concerns. This allows for the development
of complex programmes with numerous components without compromising the
maintainability of the code.

Secondly, Django provides a lot of built-in functionality out of the
box, which saves time and effort during development. For example, Django
includes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that allows
developers to interact with databases using Python objects, as well as a
robust authentication system for user management.

Thirdly, Django has an engaged community that actively supports the
framework\'s growth and upkeep. This indicates that a wide variety of
third-party packages and extensions are readily available and can
increase the capabilities of the framework and speed up development.

Along with these benefits, Django\'s outstanding documentation,
scalability, and security capabilities are some of the other benefits of
adopting it for web development. Django is also open-source and free,
which makes it available to a variety of developers and organisations.

Overall, the decision to use Django for the Perfect Parking application
was based on its combination of ease of use, built-in functionality, and
strong community support, which makes it a popular choice for building
web applications of all sizes and complexities.

### Customising Django

## Enable Django REST framework.

To enable the client-server rest functionality the Django REST framework
toolkit  needs to be installed. Add \'rest_framework\' to
your INSTALLED_APPS setting. All pip install requirements are handles by
the requirements.txt

1\. INSTALLED_APPS = \[

2\. #\...

3\. \'rest_framework\',

4\. \]

PerfectParkingWebsite\\settings.py

If you\'re intending to use the browsable API, you\'ll probably also
want to add REST framework\'s login and logout views. Add the following
to your root urls.py file.

1\. urlpatterns = \[

2\. #\...

3\. path(\'api-auth/\', include(\'rest_framework.urls\'))

4\. \]

PerfectParkingWebsite\\urls.py

Note that the URL path value of \'api-auth/\' can be whatever you want.

### Server

serializers.py

serializers.py defines the serializers used to convert the ParkingLot
and ParkingLotMonitor models to JSON format for use in the app\'s API.

1\. class ParkingLotSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):

2\.     class Meta:

3\.         model = ParkingLot

4\.         fields = \[\'id\', \'name\', \'latitude\', \'longitude\'\]

PerfectParking\\serializers.py -- ParkingLotSerializer

### Working with GPS data

The function get_gps_point creates a GPS for the ParkingLotMonitor from
its' latitude and longitude values. The function get_distance_from_point
calculates the distance between a user GPS point and the
ParkingLotMonitor GPS point . Note this distance value is the distance
of a direct line (path) and does not account for paths of roads.

1\. from geopy.distance import geodesic

## Getting user's location

This JavaScript code defines a function called setPosition that checks
if the user\'s browser supports geolocation. If it does, it uses the
browser\'s geolocation to get the user\'s current position and assigns
the latitude and longitude values to form fields with IDs \"latitude\"
and \"longitude\". If geolocation is not supported, it displays a
message in an HTML element with ID \"display\" and disables a button
with ID \"search-near-me-button\". The

### How They Work Together

The client and server communicate with each other through the REST API
service. When the client sends a request to the server, it includes
information such as the endpoint to access, any data to send in the
request body, and any headers to include with the request. The
server-side code receives the request and processes it, querying the
database or performing other operations based on the data included in
the request. The server then sends a response back to the client, which
includes a status code indicating whether the request was successful or
not, any data to include in the response body, and any headers to
include with the response. The server-side then processes the response,
displaying the data on the website for probability of parking available
so the user can view it. This cycle of request and response is how the
client and server are linked together in a web application.

# Testing and Results

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are a type of software testing that involves testing
individual units or components of a larger software system. Unit
testing\'s goal is to verify that every single piece of code is
operating as intended and adhering to design specifications. (TechTarget
, 2023)

In most cases, developers write unit tests as they write the
application\'s code, these tests are usually automated. They are made to
be quickly and regularly executed, enabling programmers to and correct
flaws early in the development cycle. (Ingrassellino, 2021)

Developers write code to test every individual function, method, or
class in the software system during unit testing. To make sure that the
code generates the desired output for each combination of inputs, they
supply test data and anticipated results for each unit before running
the tests. (Kolodiy, n.d.)

For software to be dependable, manageable, and scalable, unit tests are
crucial. They can assist in identifying issues early in the development
process, which makes fixing them simpler and less expensive.
Additionally, they aid in ensuring that modifications to the code don\'t
ruin already-existing functionality. (Ingrassellino, 2021)

Overall, unit tests are an important part of the software development
process and are essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of
software applications.

### Unit Tests Used in The Project

## Behaviour Driven Development (BBD) Testing

A software development process called behaviour-driven development (BDD)
expands on the ideas behind test-driven development (TDD). But it
emphasises cooperation and communication more than ever between
technical and non-technical stakeholders. The goal of BDD is to
guarantee that everyone involved with the development process is aware
of the specifications and goals for the software that is being created.
(Tricentis, 2018)

Instead of just developing and passing tests, BDD focuses on defining
and implementing the software\'s expected behaviour. This is
accomplished by using the specialised language \"Gherkin,\" which
enables programmers, testers, and business stakeholders to specify the
desired behaviour of the software in a form that is clear to all
parties. (Das, 2022)

One of the key benefits of BDD is that it helps to ensure that everyone
involved in the development process is on the same page. The danger of
miscommunication and misunderstandings between technical and
non-technical stakeholders is reduced by establishing a common
vocabulary and outlining the desired behaviour of the software up front.
(Das, 2022)

BDD also has the potential to raise the bar on the software that is
being created. Developers and testers may make sure that the software
satisfies the needs and expectations of the end users by concentrating
on the desired behaviour of the product.

BDD also promotes team member participation and communication, which can
assist to break down silos and make sure that everyone is working
towards the same objective. This can lead to greater efficiency and
productivity, as well as a more positive and collaborative working
environment. (Testingxperts, 2023)

Overall, Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an approach to software
development that places a strong emphasis on collaboration and
communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. By
defining the desired behaviour of the software upfront and using a
common language, it can help to ensure that everyone involved in the
development process is working towards a common goal and that the
software being developed meets the requirements and expectations of the
end-users.

### BDD In Perfect Parking

BDD testing was not used during the development of the Perfect Parking
application due to limited time available for its implementation. As a
solo developer in the project, collaboration with others was not
possible, the time and effort required for BDD testing was perceived as
a barrier to meeting project deadlines.

However, if there were plans to develop a large new project, there are
still several reasons why BDD testing would be considered. First, BDD
testing can help ensure that software meets the business requirements
and user needs, which can result in a higher quality product that better
meets the needs of users.

Finally, BDD testing can also help improve developers understanding of
the project requirements and improve the efficiency of the development
process.

Overall, while limited time and a lack of collaboration may have made it
difficult to implement BDD testing in the development of the Perfect
Parking application, there are still many benefits to using BDD testing
in a new solo project that make it worth considering.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

A software development process called Test-Driven Development (TDD)
places a strong emphasis on creating automated tests before creating any
production code. In test-driven development (TDD), the developer creates
a test that outlines a desired software feature or behaviour, runs the
test to discover its failure, and then writes the code to make the test
pass. The process is then repeated with additional tests until the
desired functionality is complete. (Unadkat, 2023)

With TDD, the developer is forced to consider the desired behaviour of
the code before actually developing it because tests must be written
first. This produces more modular, maintainable code that is also less
prone to problems. It also allows for easier refactoring of code later,
as the tests act as a safety net to catch any unintended changes that
may have been introduced. (Santacroce, 2022)

TDD typically involves theses following steps:

-   **Writing a failing test:** The developer purposefully constructs a
    test that fails even though it defines the desired behaviour of the
    code. The test is written before writing any code for production.

-   **Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass:** The
    developer then creates the minimum amount of code required to pass
    the failing test. This code was written exclusively for the purpose
    of passing the test.

-   **Refactor the code:** When the test passes, the developer can
    refactor the code without affecting its functionality in order to
    make it easier to maintain.

-   **Repeat:** The developer then repeats the process with additional
    tests until the desired functionality is complete. (Steinfeld, 2020)

![What is TDD (Test Driven
Development)?](./docs/images/thesis/media/image27.png){width="3.4380238407699037in"
height="2.775in"}

[]{#_Toc133573292 .anchor}Figure 25: How TDD Works (BasuMallick, 2022)

TDD can help increase productivity in addition to code quality by
decreasing time spent on debugging and by establishing a clear set of
requirements for the software being built. It does, however, require
some upfront effort in writing the tests upfront, which may not be
desirable for smaller projects or teams with fewer resources.

Overall, TDD is a powerful technique for writing high-quality,
maintainable code, and can be especially useful in larger, more complex
software projects.

### TDD in Perfect Parking

TDD wasn't used in the development of Perfect Parking for several
reasons. Firstly, when working on a solo project, it didn't feel
necessary to write the tests because the code could be simply tested as
its written. Additionally, it can be difficult to justify the additional
time investment required for TDD when working on the project solo.
However, even on a solo project, TDD can help to ensure that the code is
of high quality and easier to maintain. Additionally, writing tests
upfront can help to prevent regressions and ensure that the code works
as expected, even if you come back to the project months or years later.

Secondly, TDD also wasn't used in the development of the solo project,
such as the Perfect Parking application, was due to the limited
knowledge of TDD and the lack of time to learn how to implement it
effectively.

In conclusion, there are several good reasons why TDD might not have
been used in the creation of your Perfect Parking. These include
the lack of familiarity with TDD and the lack of free time to learn more
about it. However, learning about TDD might be a worthwhile time and
effort investment if interested in developing abilities and producing
higher quality code.

If another project was to be developed in the future TDD would be
implemented for several reasons:

Firstly, TDD can help ensure that the code is well-structured and
maintainable, which can be especially important for larger projects.

Secondly, TDD can help improve the quality of the code. By promoting
modular, reusable, and maintainable code, TDD can ensure that each
component of the code works as intended and fits into the larger system.

Thirdly, TDD can increase confidence in code changes. By having a
comprehensive suite of tests, developers can be confident that their
code changes will not negatively affect other parts of the system.

Lastly, TDD can improve collaboration between developers and teams. By
providing a common language for discussing code changes and ensuring
that everyone is on the same page in terms of what the code should do,
TDD can reduce communication errors and misunderstandings between
developers.

In conclusion, using TDD in a software development project can result in
higher-quality code, a better user experience, and increased developer
efficiency. TDD can ensure the success of upcoming project by
identifying problems earlier in the development process, encouraging
modular and maintainable code, boosting confidence in code
modifications, and enhancing teamwork.

## Functionality

During testing, the Perfect Parking application demonstrated strong
functionality in displaying the availability of parking spots based on
real-time data collected by the ParkingLotMonitor. The ParkingLotMonitor
allows the user to mark out parking spots that they want to be
continuously monitored for their occupancy status. Whenever there is a
change in the availability of a parking spot the mapped-out spaces turn
green for available and red for occupied, the monitor sends the
probability of it being available to the Perfect Parking application.
The application then displays the availability of the car park to the
user in real-time by displaying the probability of available parking
spaces, Overall, the application\'s functionality met the project\'s
objectives and proved to be a valuable tool for drivers seeking parking
in urban or congested areas. However, some minor issues were identified
during testing, such as if a shadow is casted over a parking spot and it
changes the colour gradient in the space the monitor would think that
the space is full when in theory it's not. If the project was to go
further in the future this minor issue would be fixed.

## Usability

The usability of the ParkingLotMonitor and Perfect Parking website were
both tested during the evaluation process. The ParkingLotMonitor
interface was found to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing a user
to easily mark out and monitor parking spots. The monitor also
accurately reported the availability of parking spots in real-time, with
color-coding providing a clear visual indication of the status of each
spot. The Perfect Parking website was also found to be intuitive and
easy to use. The website provided an interface where users could view
the availability of parking spots in real-time. The website allowed
signed-in users to view a car park\'s availability, and when the car
park was selected, it showed a Google map of the parking location, where
they could get directions to the car park if they wish. Overall, the
usability of both the ParkingLotMonitor and Perfect Parking website was
strong, with minimal issues or confusion reported during testing.

# Conclusions 

Based on the research and analysis conducted in this project, it can be
concluded that the use of AI and object detection in images is an
effective solution for identifying the status of parking spots
(free/taken) in towns and cities such as Limerick. By implementing this
technology, it is possible to monitor car parks in real-time,

## Application Performance

The PerfectParking application performed exceptionally well, exceeding
expectations. The application was able to efficiently send updates to
the server and display the results in the application, which was even
better than expected. This highlights the effectiveness of the
application\'s design and development, as it was able to meet and
surpass the needs and expectations.

## Future Development

While developing the Perfect Parking application the use of statistical
analysis and machine learning on big data was limited by
time.[]{#_Toc133652027 .anchor} For example, here is a graph based on
randomly generated records of car park activity generated.

height="4.416666666666667in"}

Figure 26 Parking Test Data Histogram

Using Machine learning with collected real world big data the
application could give predictions of a car park's occupancy for a time
in the future and answer user queries e.g., "Will there be available
parking like tomorrow at 3:00 PM in Limerick city?"

By adding local and cultural context to data points predictions could be
improved beyond a typical Monday to Sunday and hours predication e.g.,
parking in Limerick city at 3:00 PM on an average Tuesday is not the
same as parking on 3:00 PM on Christmas EVE on a Tuesday. With enough
collected data over long time spans the application could make
predictions for holidays.

This data analysis and the predictions could be used to help with urban
planning i.e., the need to build (or not) more car parks.

### Collecting of data

A possible solution is to build a parking space sensor using a raspberry
pi and putting this down in a parking space in either the college or in
the city, but be aware of doing this brings problems:

-   Permission must be sought from the parking companies to allow
    sensors to be placed on their parking premises.

-   If permission is granted the sensor would only be on a raspberry pi
    it could easily get damaged or stolen.

## Reflections

During this FYP, a deep understanding of computer vision techniques and
their practical applications using OpenCV was gained. Additionally, the
historical development of Haar classifiers and wavelets was studied,
which helped appreciate the evolution of these key concepts in the
field.

Furthermore, programming skills, particularly in Python, were honed
through the implementation of this project. This experience taught
valuable lessons in project management, design, and implementation.
Accomplishments were made and a meaningful contribution to the field of
computer vision was achieved.

Overall, the knowledge gained, and the skills developed broadened the
understanding of computer vision and prepared for taking on new
challenges in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. The opportunity
to pursue this research was appreciated and the new skills and knowledge
will be applied in future endeavours.

To conclude this thesis, a challenging yet rewarding journey was
experienced that allowed delving deeply into the field of computer
vision. Through research and implementation of the FYP project, valuable
knowledge and skills were gained that will serve well in future academic
and professional pursuits.

Looking ahead, the knowledge and skills acquired through this thesis
will be utilized in future academic and professional endeavours. The
prospects of this journey are exciting and there is a strong belief that
the lessons learned, and experiences gained will serve as valuable
guidance throughout the upcoming career.
