# Introduction

My Perfect Parking application was a project I designed to help people
find parking lots and spaces in their area. I developed the application
using programming languages such as Python and Java - along with key
software such as Visual Studio Code.

Python is a powerful programming language that offers numerous
advantages for implementing a successful parking application. Python is
an open-source language, meaning developers can modify and share it
freely, helping to reduce the cost, time, and effort of the development
process.

## How i i will implement the open-Cv and make it possible to count the cars in the parking lot

1.  Capture video feed from a camera or use a pre-recorded video.

2.  Pre-process the video to remove noise and enhance the image.

3.  Detect vehicles in the video using object detection techniques in
    OpenCV.

4.  Track the vehicles as they enter and exit the parking lot.

5.  Keep a count of the number of vehicles in the parking lot.

6.  Display the count on the screen and alert the user if the parking
    lot is full.

7.  Store the count data in a database for later analysis.

This is just a general outline, of how I will use openCv to count the
number of cars in the parking lot.
